<!--This is our homepage. Pranzo is a simple website that finds people their favorite lunch
The first thing users see on our website is the search box to start searching for their lunch. Other than searching
for lunch, user will be able to sign in so they can save their favorite places and check the suggestion that Pranzo
makes for lunch. To sing in user need to sing up once to the website. Links for that are located under singin button.
Also, resturant will be able to sing in and updates their menus at any time so they have separate way to sign in.
The idea is to keep it simple so every user will be able to start using without to much troubles.
